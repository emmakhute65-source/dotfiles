I have a big private git repo of notes that I keep about almost every task that
I think that I may have to do more than twice.

I manage these notes using [Emacs Org-Mode](http://orgmode.org/) and [Emacs
Deft](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/). Yes, it's amazing.

In the interest of flailing publicly, I'm posting my non-incomprehensible,
non-exploitable-info notes on the intertubes because I'm an idiot.

**Note**: These notes may still be completely incomprehensible.
