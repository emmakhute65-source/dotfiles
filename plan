* What I learned about email addresses today
:PROPERTIES:
:DATE: <2016-05-18 Wed>
:END:

I burrowed into RFC 5322's [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.4.1][Address Spec]] for a long time today. This
resulted in a fun side-trip into [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234][Augmented BNF for Syntax
Specifications: ABNF.]]

Email addresses break down to their [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234#appendix-B.1][Core Rules]] like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC txt
addr-spec       =   local-part "@" domain

addr-spec       =   dot-atom / quoted-string / obs-local-part
                    @
                    dot-atom / domain-literal / obs-domain

addr-spec       =   [CFWS] dot-atom-text [CFWS] / [CFWS]  DQUOTE *([FWS] qcontent) [FWS] DQUOTE [CFWS] / word *("." word)
                    @
                    [CFWS] dot-atom-text [CFWS] / [CFWS] "[" *([FWS] dtext) [FWS] "]" [CFWS] /  atom *("." atom)

addr-spec       =   [(1*([FWS] comment) [FWS]) / FWS] 1*atext *("." 1*atext) [(1*([FWS] comment) [FWS]) / FWS] /
                    [(1*([FWS] comment) [FWS]) / FWS] DQUOTE *([([*WSP CRLF] 1*WSP) /  obs-FWS] qtext / quoted-pair) [([*WSP CRLF] 1*WSP) /  obs-FWS] DQUOTE [(1*([FWS] comment) [FWS]) / FWS] /
                    (atom / quoted-string) *("." (atom / quoted-string))
                    @
                    ...
                    /me dies

The density of =local-part "@" domain= weighs on me.

What was impressed upon me is how fragile communication is: a means to
deliever a message becomes a dense message of its own.

* Org-mode to publish a site
:PROPERTIES:
:DATE: <2016-04-18 Mon>
:END:

** A Manifesto of sorts

This single org-mode file is a blog. The org-mode file in which
I am writing this text is filled with material that either isn't
substantive or focused enough to be published on my normal blog.

This material should be less ephemeral than things on a wiki (e.g.
The movies section, the RFCs section, the Wikipedia pages section
should be moved the [[http://blazeyandtyler.com/wiki/Blazey_and_Tyler][Wiki]]).

I tend to experiment more with format in this file than in my notes
directory (which I keep using [[http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/][Deft]] and org-mode) which means I
learn more org-mode and that is a Good Thing™.

** Some inspiration

Making a real-live multi-page cool-looking blog out of an org-mode file isn't impossible.

** Other org-related things

Can I just say: =org-babel= looks awesome as fuck.

A literate programming environment that can be used to configure a lisp-machine.

To paraphrase one of the authors below: that'll earn you a lot of nerd merit-
badges. I should maybe consider moving my [[https://github.com/thcipriani/linuxtips][Linux Tips]]
repo over to this. Also, I should move my repos off of github and onto
something self-hosted :( Too. Many. Projects. Le. Sigh.

** How I generated this page

This is a weird, psuedo literate way of updating this file on the
squiggle.city site.

First I ssh into =squiggle= using a src block with a =:session= identifier.
The actual code in the org file can be seen on [[https://github.com/thcipriani/dotfiles/blob/master/plan#L62-L64][github]].

For what it's worth, I am executing *this file* to generate *this HTML*.
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent :session squiggle
ssh squiggle
#+END_SRC

I can make sure I'm on the server, by checking the hostname, again, in
the same =:session=. One important note that it took a while to figure out:
I have to use the =:exports both= argument for the source block to show
the results in the HTML output.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :session squiggle :exports both
hostname
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: squiggle.city

I Have a file that exists as a local hack in my dotfiles on squiggle.city
server, but don't take my word for it:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results code :session squiggle :exports both
file "/home/thcipriani/bin/squigglegen"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
/home/thcipriani/bin/squigglegen: C source, ASCII text
#+END_SRC

Now, locally, without using the =:session=. I can save and commit this file
to my =.dotfiles= repo:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :exports both
/usr/bin/git -C /home/tyler/.dotfiles add plan
/usr/bin/git -C /home/tyler/.dotfiles commit -m '.plan spelling fixes'
/usr/bin/git -C /home/tyler/.dotfiles push
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [master 2655be0] Add plan from org-mode
:  1 file changed, 30 insertions(+), 18 deletions(-)

Then, back on my remote session, I can pull this code down, and regenerate my
page using the =squigglegen= command.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :session squiggle :results output :exports both
/home/thcipriani/bin/squigglegen
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...

If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of
exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea,
which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to
himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the
possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it.

The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure
thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by
exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy
to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual
structures... Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real
in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate
from the construct itself. [...] The magic of myth and legend has come
true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a
display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.

pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows:
