- Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment.
  So if things aren't going well, it probably means you're learning a lot
  and things will go better later.

Gall's Law

A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple
system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and
cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working
simple system.

"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of
exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea,
which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to
himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the
possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it."

"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure
thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by
exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy
to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual
structures... Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real
in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate
from the construct itself. [...] The magic of myth and legend has come
true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a
display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be."

"The first man who, having fenced in a piece of land, said 'This is mine,'
and found people naïve enough to believe him, that man was the true
founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars, and murders, from
how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved mankind, by
pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows:
Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget
that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth
itself to nobody."
