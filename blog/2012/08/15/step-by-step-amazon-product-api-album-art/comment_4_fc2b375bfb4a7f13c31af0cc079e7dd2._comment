I did forget to mention that in order to get an affiliate ID you need to
become an associate. To become an associate, follow instructions here: [http:/
/docs.aws.amazon.com/AWS...](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/la
test/GSG/GettingSetUp.html).

If you have all your credentials correct, and your include path is correct,
then this works. I just tested it today.
