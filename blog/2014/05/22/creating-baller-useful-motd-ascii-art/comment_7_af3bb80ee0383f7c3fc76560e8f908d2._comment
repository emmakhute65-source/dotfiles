@sigilo:disqus I don't think you missed anything. I think it's just how that
program is designed: it's meant to make files for use with ponysay
[https://github.com/erkin/ponys...](https://github.com/erkin/ponysay) which is
what you're seeing.

You could try something as simple as `./img2ponysay [whatever] | tr -d
'$balon5\\'` or cook up something with grep -Ev

Sorry not much helpâ€”never tried to generate art dynamically.
