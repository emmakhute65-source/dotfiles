Make sure you have the util-say.jar file (`find /path/to/util-say -name 'util-
say.jar'`), make sure your permissions are correct (I assume that read
permissions are probably fine, but you may need execute—I also assume that the
git repo likely has correct permissions), and also make sure you're in the
correct directory when you run ./img2ponysay—probably won't work running
`/home/user/Downloads/util-say/img2ponysay`.

I say “Probably” because I've never tested that theory.
