yup, make did the trick! thank you! its now working but with a small caveat
(easy to fix anyway). When i run cat on the generated TXT or when is displayed
as the MOTD, some characaters display before the image:

$balloon5$

$\$

$\$

$\$

Fixed by editing the TXT file and erasing those lines at the begining, but, is
it caused by something i missed? is there a way to prevent that from
happening?

I'm trying to implement a dynamic auto-generated MOTD

BTW, thanks so much for the reply and the tut! :)
