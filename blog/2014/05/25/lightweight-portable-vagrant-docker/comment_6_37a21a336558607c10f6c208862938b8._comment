Unfortunately, the Vagrant support for Docker as a provider isn't quite
seamless across platforms as the documentation seems to indicate. Ports are
not forwarded from the docker host vm to the main host machine automatically.
The fix is to use a proxy Vagrantfile that explicitly forwards the ports you
need. See [https://gist.github.com/audion...](https://gist.github.com/audioner
d/d7d77d9af080a7a87d9b) for a discussion of the issue and
[https://github.com/simono/vm-e...](https://github.com/simono/vm-
examples/blob/master/docker-host/Vagrantfile) for a simple and lightweight
proxy Vagrantfile.
