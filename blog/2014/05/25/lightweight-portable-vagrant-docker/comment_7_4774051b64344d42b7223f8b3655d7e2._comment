Unfortunately, it seems that as of Vagrant 1.6, the Vagrant support for Docker
as a provider isn't quite seamless across platforms as the documentation seems
to indicate. Ports are not forwarded from the docker host vm to the main host
machine automatically. The fix is to use a proxy Vagrantfile that explicitly
forwards the ports you need. See [https://gist.github.com/audion...](https://g
ist.github.com/audionerd/d7d77d9af080a7a87d9b) for a discussion of the issue
and [https://github.com/simono/vm-e...](https://github.com/simono/vm-
examples/blob/master/docker-host/Vagrantfile) for a simple and lightweight
proxy Vagrantfile.
