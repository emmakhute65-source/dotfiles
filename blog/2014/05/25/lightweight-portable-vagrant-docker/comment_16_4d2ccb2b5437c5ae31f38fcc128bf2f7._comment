I'm unclear if you're telling me something is wrong in my post, or if you're
asking for help. Also, in future, use of a pastebin would be appreciated.

It is difficult to troubleshoot without knowing the contents of the
Vagrantfile and os/version of host; however, what is clear is that whatever
you're sending the `<<` message to is an object that doesn't respond to that
method. In my example above, `d.ports` is an [Array]([http://docs.ruby-
lang.org/en/2...](http://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Array.html#method-i-3C-
3C)) that does accept the `<<` message.

It's entirely possible something about Vagrantfiles has changed in the almost
exactly 2 years since this post.
