* Contacts

Install goobook:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo pip2 install -U goobook
#+END_SRC

I ran into some problems in arch, had to upgrade/reinstall a few deps:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
(ﾉ^ヮ^)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ sudo pip2 install -U pyasn1
(ﾉ^ヮ^)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ sudo pip2 install -U cryptography
#+END_SRC

goobook then needs to authenticate with gmail:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
goobook authenticate
#+END_SRC

Once you go through the oauth song and dance you should be able to run a ~query~
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
(ﾉ^ヮ^)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ goobook query tyler

thcipriani@gmail.com	Tyler Cipriani	other groups: "System Group: Friends"
#+END_SRC

From there, just need to add a bit of magic to the ~~/.muttrc~ file
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
set query_command="goobook query %s"
macro index,pager a \
    "<pipe-message>goobook add<return>" "add sender to google contacts"
bind editor <Tab> complete-query
#+END_SRC
* Viewing URLs

Install urlview: ncurses program parses urls out of text.

Create a ~$HOME/urlview~ file:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
COMMAND xdg-open %s &
#+END_SRC

Bind =\,u= in the editor:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
macro pager ,u "|urlview<enter>" "call urlview to open links"
#+END_SRC
* Searching Mail

Searching works really well via ~notmuch~

Afer install, setup via
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
notmuch setup
#+END_SRC

After setup, it's just a matter of calling

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
notmuch new
#+END_SRC

to index the things
