Today I was working with a PDF that was 27,000 pages long (god help me).

I never tried to open that PDF. This is just the page count I got from
a python script I wrote to parse that PDF to a CSV file.

When the time came to spot-check the results of that python script
I needed to compare some pages deep within the PDF with the output
on the CSV file.

I use the [[https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/][Zathura]] document viewer to view PDFs, but I was reasonably
certain that it would choke on such a large document. Instead I extracted
one page at a time using [[https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php][ImageMagick]].

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
convert 'big.pdf[2000]' big-pg2000.pdf
#+END_SRC

Then I opened the generated PDF using Zathura.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
zathura big-pg2000.pdf
#+END_SRC

I was able to compare that side-by-side with the generated CSV.

Easy peasy.
