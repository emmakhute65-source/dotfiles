This article was really helpful, thanks! I'm trying to understand the significance of DAGs when it comes to networked storage such as IPFS. I was a bit surprised that git doesn't store files in blocks to reduce duplication but I suppose it was originally meant for source code rather than binary data.

Cheers,
Durand
