# Version 1.0

## Overview

This is the first iteration of my DotFiles that I've given a version, or even
a description.

This is a *major* change. I've decided to combine my major personal git repos
into One Giant Repo™.

This repo now includes my photos, my blog, and my dotfiles.

Look. I know. This sounds crazy.

This is the git repo as an intimate personal archive. The foundation of my
personal computing is this dotfiles repo. I also almost always clone my
`~/Picutres` directory on personal machines as well. I don't always clone my
blog, but it's fairly small. I'd also like the wall between my blog and my
photos to be more permeable and this change supports that goal.

This could be a dumb idea. I don't know. I've never tried it – I don't know
anyone who has. I can back out of this if it's a dumb idea...probably.
