            Overlay of two photos. One photo is taken at 70mm, and one is taken
            at 24mm

            This is a gif that demonstrates the entire focal range of a Nikor
            24-70mm f/2.8 G. If you open the "large" version of this image, you
            can probably see the actual focal-length for each frame.

        title: Walk and Zoom
        caption: |
            This is a series of photos in which I am trying to keep the framing
            of the picture the same while backing away from the subject and
            simultaniously zooming-in. As the focal length gets longer, the
            background gets closer. The longer the focal length, the less depth
            an image seems to have. If you view the "large" version of this
            image you can see the focal-length for each frame.
