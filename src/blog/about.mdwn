## An Autohagiography

I'm depressing to follow on social media.

I [[make beer|brewing]].
I really like [coffee](https://tylercipriani.com/coffee-extract).
I have taken a [[photo|tags/photos]] or two in my day.

I work remotely for the [Wikimedia Foundation](
https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home) from my home in Longmont, Colorado
although my views do not represent the views of my employer. I have worked for
other places, and I have listed those places on my [[Résumé|hireme]].

My [dotfiles](https://github.com/thcipriani/dotfiles/) may be the only thing
standing between humanity and certain destruction -- I don't really know for
sure.

I believe in a robust, free, and open internet. The internet -- as it exists
currently -- is fragile, centralized, and is vulnerable to (and increasingly
captured and subverted by) longstanding societal power structures. I believe a
digital dark age is coming and/or here. I believe we will continue down the
path of destroying the internet because we need regulation to stop it, and the
current state of late-stage capitalism means that politicians are beholden to
different class of people than me.

I guess this is a rambly way of saying that I've lost faith in real democracy
and the internet is dead.

I &#128569; the internet. I worry about it all the time.
