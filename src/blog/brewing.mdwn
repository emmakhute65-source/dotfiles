I have been homebrewing since 2007. I am the former the president of the
Wichita Homebrewers Organization (and I designed their logo!). I am a
recognized BJCP judge and an AHA member. I've won a fair number of regional and
national competition medals for my beer and mead including a national gold
medal for my [[Tupelo Mead|brewing/nhc-2014-gold-medal-tupelo-mead]] at the
National Homebrew Competition in 2014.
