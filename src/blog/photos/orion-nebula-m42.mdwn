This is the Great Orion Nebula, M42. I realizd this is fairly easy to see with
a sufficient optical boost from my backyard which is roughly bortle 6/7. This
is my second night trying to image this object (or any DSO, actually).

This is a stack of 10x88-second exposures (roughly 15 minutes total exposure
time). Polar-alignment on my SkyGuider Pro proved to be a bit difficult (once I
added the camera and couter balance I had to re-align), so this minutes is the
result of me fiddling for an hour and a half or so. I did all the processing
for this photo using libre software. Camera/lens correction in RawTherapee,
aligned using `align_image_stack` in hugin, average stacking using G'MIC,
final stacked image tone curve/RGB curve/saturation adjustments in RawTherapee.
