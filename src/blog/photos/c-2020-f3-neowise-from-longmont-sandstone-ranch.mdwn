Single, untracked shot of the comet NEOWISE from Sandstone Ranch in Longmont,
Colorado.

I hadn't planned on going to see the comet--it's been cloudy the last few days
and I was slowly starting to lose hope for a clear night.

An hour before this picture was taken, as I was taking the dog out just before
going to bed, I noticed the stars for the first time in days. I threw my camera
in the car, grabbed the binoculars, and drove to the highest, closest public
spot.

Blazey's niece is staying with us for a few weeks of this strange summer. We
attempted to see NEOWISE on Saturday from the same vantage, but all we found
were cloudy skies and roving hordes of teenagers. Tonight was very
different--small groups of nerds gathered around telescopes, all there to see
the same thing.
