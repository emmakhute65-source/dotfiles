Had the day off today for President's Day. Decided to spend it hunched over
taking macro photos of snowflakes. This was taken using 3 extension tubes
totaling 68mm. I found that I needed auto-focus very much so I decided to
forego doing reverse-lens work, although I think the additional magnification
would have been nice to have. This is an averages stack of 3 aligned images.
