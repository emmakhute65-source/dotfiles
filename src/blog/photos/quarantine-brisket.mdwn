- 8 lb brisket
- Morton's Kosher Salt + Black pepper about 50/50
- Hickory wood
- Start spraying brisket with beer after 3 hours
- 9am–3pm on smoker, tried to maintain 250°F–275°F
- Kept fire vent open all the time, aiming for complete combustion, opened firebox door when it got too hot
- When I couldn't raise the temp, I had to empty the ashbox and start new coals
- Stalled at 170°F for last 2 hours (between 170 and 173)
- Pulled during stall, wrapped then moved to the oven
- Moved to oven at 265°F
- Bark didn't look very dark when I pulled it, but got plenty dark in the oven
- Too salty, other than that: perfect
