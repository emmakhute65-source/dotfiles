I've been trying to read more books. In recent years my offline reading
has really taken a hit. I spend most of my day communicating through an
almost wholly text interface. While the number of words I read per day
certainly puts me in a high percentile, the quality of the words read is
probably not especially staggering.

For want of a better place to put this information, here is a list of books
I've read in 2016 as of 2016-12-14
