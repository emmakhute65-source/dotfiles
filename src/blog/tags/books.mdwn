[[!meta title="Books"]]

I've been trying to read more books. In recent years my offline reading
has really taken a hit. I spend most of my day communicating through an
almost wholly text interface. While the number of words I read per day
certainly puts me in a high percentile, the quality of the words read is
probably not especially staggering.

For want of a better place to put this information, here is a list of books
I've read in 2017 as of 2017-01-26

1. [[White Trash|https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17360507W/White_trash]] by Nancy Isenberg
2. [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|https://openlibrary.org/works/OL13716955W/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix]] by J.K. Rowling
3. [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|https://openlibrary.org/works/OL13716954W/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince]] by J.K. Rowling
4. [[Brave New World|https://openlibrary.org/works/OL64468W/Brave_New_World]] by Aldous Huxley
