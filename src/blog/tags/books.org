#+TITLE: Books
[[!meta title="Books"]]

I've been trying to read more books. In recent years my offline reading
has really taken a hit. I spend most of my day communicating through an
almost wholly text interface. While the number of words I read per day
certainly puts me in a high percentile, the quality of the words read is
probably not especially staggering.

For want of a better place to put this information, here is a list of
books I've read in 2017 as of 2017-08-11. I've included graphic novels
here as well because I game the system however I damn well please.
