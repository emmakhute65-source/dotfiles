#+TITLE: Samson Meteor Mic

* Getting it working...

I tried a few things to get the meteor mic working. I'm not sure if
any of them worked. Most of them are from the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Troubleshooting#Microphone][Arch Wiki]].

1. To check to see if mic is recognized by alsa
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    arecord -l
    #+END_SRC
   Listed like: =hw:CARD,DEVICE=, in my instance that means =hw:1,0= (card: 1; device: 0)
2. I added this in =/etc/pulse/default.pa=:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:0,0
    #+END_SRC
   And then reloaded pulse audio:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    pulseaudio -k
    #+END_SRC
3. Alsamixer remove =CAPTURE DEVICE=
   So...I have no idea if this did anything, but I opened =alsamixer=,
   selected =HDA Intel PCH= and hit =f5=, then used <SPACE> to toggle
   =CAPTURE= ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
