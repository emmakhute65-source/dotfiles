My memory is finite. And I spend a lot of my finite memory cramming in gobs of
books. One of the myriad purposes of tending a digital garden like this site is to
use it to augment the limit memory capacity of my tiny brain. So that's
what I'm doing with these reviews.

## Rating Rubric

These reviews are for me. All books are rated on a 5-star scale that represents
my enjoyment rather than any objective value of the writing or the ideas in
the book. The value of the writing and ideas may factor into my enjoyment,
but my rating isn't meant to represent that.

----------- -------------------------------------------------------------
⭑–⭑⭑½       This book was a waste of my time in inverse proportion to the
            star rating

⭑⭑⭑         I don't know/I feel mixed

⭑⭑⭑½        I enjoyed it, but there were problems

⭑⭑⭑⭑        I enjoyed it, but maybe not for everyone

⭑⭑⭑⭑½–⭑⭑⭑⭑⭑ I enjoyed it so much that I would recommend it to others in
            proportion to the star rating

The idea to rate books and how to do it well was stolen from many sources, but
some credit is due to [Russ Allbery's phenomenal book
reviews](https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/reviews/) and [Tom
MacWright](https://macwright.com/2017/12/11/indieweb-reading.html)'s blog post
about owning his reading log.
