## Structured Reading

At the beginning of this year, I randomly downloaded the Harvard Classics/Dr.
Eliot's Five Foot Shelf of books. This is a set of books that contains a
selection of classic readings meant to provide a full classic liberal education
in themselves.

My first exposure to this series was at my Granny's house where she owned a
subset of the shelf. I've never had a mind to read the entirety of the
shelf.

Volume 50 of the 50-volume series contains several suggestions of the ways
in which a reader may choose to tackle the task of intelligently navigating
the embarrassment of material in the collection. I've naively chosen to follow
the first suggested course of reading: [The history of civilization](https://archive.org/details/harvardclassics50eliouoft/page/n33/mode/2up?q=Class).

Here I'll track my progress and notes:

*  (‚ùå Not finished) [[Race and Language by Edward Augustus Freeman|books/2021/race-and-language-freeman]]
* [[The Book of Job|books/2021/book-of-job]]
* [[An Account of Egypt by Herodotus|books/2021/egypt-by-herodotus]]
* [[The Odyssey by Homer|books/2021/odyssey-homer]]
* [[The Oresteia by Aeschylus|books/2021/oresteia-aeschylus]]
* Oedipus the King & Antigone by Sophocles
* Hippolytus by Euripides
* The Aeneid by Virgil
* The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin by Benjamin Franklin

* * *

## Final thoughts on 2021

Depending on how you count (if you count the _Book of Job_ as a "book") I read
either 37 or 38 books this year. I read more books this year than I've ever
read in any previous year. My Kindle tells me that I read every single day this
year (or at least I unlocked my Kindle).

I read every night before bed and sometimes I read a few pages as soon as I wake
up. I "read" eight of these books on audible, but I ended up buying additional
copies of _Deep Work_, _Atomic Habits_, and _Measure What Matters_ because they
all had so much good content, and it was easier to take notes using digital or
print editions.

I read the remainder of these books on my Kindle. I love the reading experience of
the Kindle, and I recently learned about
[readwise](https://readwise.io/bookcision) which helps me export all my notes
from my kindle to my computer. I bought a [book
stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IV6U0U/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
at the end of 2021. My goal is to use it to read an actual **physical** book
and take notes on my computer. Prior to this year (and my discovery of
readwise), I most likely would have said physical books were my preferred
format. At the end of 2021, I tend to prefer reading on the Kindle; however, there are a few books that don't lend themselves
very well to the paperwhite (any of the Tufte books for example).

Unlike in years past, I didn't read any graphic novels this year --- this is
another Kindle limitation. I think I'll revisit that in 2022 --- I'd like to
try some mangas (not that I have any idea where to start).

As of today (2022-01-01), there are six books that I'm more than 30% of the way
through. I have plans to finish at least two of them, so that should give me a
headstart on my 50 book(!) goal for 2022 üòÖ.
