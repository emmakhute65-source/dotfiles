## Structured Reading

At the beginning of this year, I randomly downloaded the Harvard Classics/Dr.
Eliot's Five Foot Shelf of books. This is a set of books that contains a
selection of classic readings meant to provide a full classic liberal education
in themselves.

My first exposure to this series was at my Granny's house where she owned a
subset of the shelf. I've never had a mind to read the entirety of the
shelf.

Volume 50 of the 50-volume series contains several suggestions of the ways
in which a reader may choose to tackle the task of intelligently navigating
the embarrassment of material in the collection. I've naively chosen to follow
the first suggested course of reading: [The history of civilization](https://archive.org/details/harvardclassics50eliouoft/page/n33/mode/2up?q=Class).

Here I'll track my progress and notes:

* [[Race and Language by Edward Augustus Freeman|books/2021/race-and-language-freeman]]
* [[The Book of Job|books/2021/book-of-job]]
* [[An Account of Egypt by Herodotus|books/2021/egypt-by-herodotus]]
* [[The Odyssey by Homer|books/2021/odyssey-homer]]
* [[The Oresteia by Aeschylus|books/2021/oresteia-aeschylus]]
* Oedipus the King & Antigone by Sophocles
* Hippolytus by Euripides
* The Aeneid by Virgil
* The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin by Benjamin Franklin
