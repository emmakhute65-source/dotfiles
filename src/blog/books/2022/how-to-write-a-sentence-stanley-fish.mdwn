Annie Dillard in <u>The Writing Life</u> tells the story of a university
who asked if they could become a writer — a well-known writer responded, "do you like sentences?"

## Three sentence summary

<u>How to Write a Sentence</u> is a book about sentence appreciation. The first part of the book contains great
sentences, pulls their components apart, and examines what makes them
exceptional -- it seems like a book filled with deliberate practice exercises
for the budding writer.

From there, the book wears on a scattershot -- hit and miss -- by the end we're
talking about famous "Last Sentences" in books and movies (including,
bizarrely, the film "Some Like It Hot") -- it turns out last sentences have
nothing in common and are not very interesting as a topic -- this book felt
like a very short interesting book made into a longer (but still short)
uninteresting book.

## Details

Despite the title, the book is about sentence appreciation and not sentence writing.

I powered through the book, propelled by the early chapter's linguistic fun:

* Looking at anaphora in Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "[Letter from Birmingham Jail](https://letterfromjail.com/)"
* Exploring form independent from content in Lewis Carroll's "[Jabberwocky](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42916/jabberwocky)"
* Noam Chomsky's, "colorless green ideas sleep furiously" vs "furiously sleep ideas green colorless" as an example of grammatical vs semantic correctness

I also found some enjoyment in the chapter on first sentences -- a [LitHub article](https://lithub.com/what-makes-a-great-opening-line/) I recently read about the same topic covers all the same content.
