## Three sentence summary

Klara is an artificial friend (AF), which is a solar-powered, blade-runner-level tween android
and general-AI sold (at what I picture as the Apple Store) to
rich, non-android tweens to help build their social skills.

Rich kids, like Josie, Klara's "owner" (the dynamics of tween/AF relations
are purposefully cringy at times), undergo gene splicing (called _lifting_) when they're
very young because of the gattaca-esque nature of college admissions in this
timeline; however, gene splicing is very risky and can cause serious illness or
death.

**Possible spoiler alerts from here forward**

In the novel they say that Klara is "special" and "observant"; Mr Capaldi, the
creepy artist rants at length about how we have so much to learn from AFs and
says Klara is remarkable; so what seems like a naïve/make-believe bargain
between Klara and the Sun for Josie's life may be more than it appears to dumb
[thinking meat](https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html) like us.

## Random thoughts

Early in the book we meet Rosa, the same generation AF as Klara who is
displayed in the AF store along-side her. Early in the novel we see Klara looking out for Rosa:

> When I was lucky enough to see [the Sun] like that, I'd lean my face forward to
> take in as much of his nourishment as I could, and if Rosa was with me, I'd
> tell her to do the same.

And then briefly, as an aside, in a particularly distressing scene

> I [...] saw the lonely woman sitting by herself at Mr Vance's diner, unnoticed
> even by the diner manager, pressing her forehead against the window towards the
> dark street outside, and it occurred to me how very much the woman resembled
> Rosa.

The end of the novel questions human's obligations to general AI. We're awful in all timelines.
