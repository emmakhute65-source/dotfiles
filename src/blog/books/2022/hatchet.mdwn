## Three sentence summary

Hatchet tells the story of Brian Robeson a thirteen-year old boy going to visit
his father for the summer in the oil-fields of of the Northern-Canadian
wilderness. When the pilot of his tiny plane suffers a heart-attack enroute,
Brian crash lands and spends the ensuing 54-days learning lessons about
survival and personal resilience. This book was a Newbery medal winner from
around the time I was in elementary school.

## Details

The book reminds me of Starship Troopers insofar as it preaches pull yourself up by your bootstraps kind of self-reliance that I'm conflicted about.
