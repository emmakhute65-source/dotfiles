## Three sentence summary
<div itemprop="reviewBody">
Paul Theroux's memoir of his travels across Europe and Asia by rail wherein he recounts detailed conversations with people he encounters.

The journey by rail takes him on the (sadly now defunct, [I
checked](https://www.seat61.com/history-of-the-orient-express.htm)) Orient
Express to Vienna, then to Istanbul, Tehran, through Afganistan, to Peshawar,
then a zig-zagging path through India[^1], a plane ride to Yangon (née Rangoon)
in Myanmar (née Burma), Mandalay, then on to Thailand, Singapore, another plane
ride to Vietnam, then another plane to Japan, and finally the trip home on the
famous Trans-Siberian.

There are enjoyable moments of glib humor, a lot of sex workers and other
unfortunate travelers where the glib humor is less enjoyable, and a frank look
at America's influence of Vietnam as of 1975.

[^1]: Lahore → Delhi, Delhi → Shimla, Shimla → Mumbai (née Bombay) by way of
Jaipur (this is confusing—there's a chapter about Jaipur after mentioning
Mumbai, but it seems silly to go Delhi→Mumbai→Jaipur→Chennai—this is a
guess/it's unclear), Mumbai → Chennai (née Madras), Chennai → Colombo, Sri Lanka (née
Ceylon) → Galle, Sri Lanka, Galle → Chennai, Chennai→Kolkata (née Calcutta)
