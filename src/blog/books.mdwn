[[!meta title="Book Things"]]

I've been trying to read more books. In recent years my offline reading
has really taken a hit. I spend most of my day communicating through an
almost wholly text interface. While the number of words I read per day
certainly puts me in a high percentile, the quality of the words read is
probably not especially staggering.

Anyway, here's my book things:

* [[Books read in 2020|books/2020]]
* [[Books read in 2019|books/2019]]
* [[Books read in 2018|books/2018]]
* [[Books read in 2017|books/2017]]
* [[Books read in 2016|books/2016]]
* [[Books to read|books/to-read]]
