[[!meta title="Bloop! Audible Error Logs"]]
[[!tag computing]]

As a frequent deployer of software, I'm usually watching several different
flavors of system monitoring all at the same time.  A few logstash dashboards
in a few browser windows, a few grafana dashboards, a few different logs being
tailed in a few different tmux windows.

If it all goes wrong during a deployment -- if the error log suddenly explodes
-- I want to know.  Even if I'm looking at another metric, or at IRC, or at my
email -- I want to know about log explosion immediately.

So I made a thing that plays a little noise whenever a new line is recieved on
stdin. I call it [Bloop!](https://notabug.org/thcipriani/bloop)

And I've been using it to tail logs like:

    ssh logsever -- tail -f /var/log/important/error.log | bloop -s

So now my stomach drops when I hear, "bloop...bloop...blobloopboopbloop".

I'm sure this thing has been build a million times because it's a
braindead-simple idea, but I couldn't find the right words to search for it so
I made new one. Now all I need is an EKG monitor so I can see how much this
bloop thing makes my heart rate match the overall error rate.
