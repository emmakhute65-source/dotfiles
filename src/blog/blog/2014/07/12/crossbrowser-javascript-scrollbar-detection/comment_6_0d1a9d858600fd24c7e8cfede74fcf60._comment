Hi,

Thanks for the great write up!  

Could you please go until a bit more detail regarding how we would apply the code?  

For example,
I'd like to do a check to see if the scrollbar exists and is pushing the content over and, if so, then add a class to the body. How would this be done?

I basically want to be able to do the following:

if ( hasScrollBar ) {
    $('body').addClass('window_has_scrollbar');
}
