THANKS for sharing your project folder structure man! That's the first post i
found showing that stuff. I'll definitely use this structure for learning
about docker. Thanks again :)

Suggestion: As a OSX user i don't have docker on my machine. Why not add
"d.image = "ubuntu/latest" in the vagrant file instead of using this command
before do a vagrant up ?
