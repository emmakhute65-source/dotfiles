Keyboard shortcuts are the ish nizzle, they speed up your computing, they
simplify navigation, they're old school. If you can't navigate your
filesystem/computer without touching your mouse, then you aren't as cool as me,
and that's the straight dope. I'm writing this because I saw an article today
on the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/"
target="_blank">lifehacker website</a> about <a
href="http://lifehacker.com/software/video-demonstration/master-the-windows-key-267179.php"
target="_blank">mastering the windows key</a>. All the article really was was
<a
href="http://www.metacafe.com/fplayer/627735/8_uses_for_the__windows__key_on_your_keyboard__quite_useful.swf"
target="_blank">this video</a>. Actually, the video was <i>kind of</i>
inaccurate. Sure, it's true that you use Windows Key+Pause/Break key to bring
up System Properties, but what if you don't have a combo pause/break key? Well,
if you're using XP you use WINDOWS_KEY+Pause and if you're using windows vista you use WINDOWS_KEY+break.<br /> 				Another thing about
keyboard shortcuts is that you can <i>make</i> a keyboard shortcut for any
program (or shortcut to a program) on your desktop by: (1) Right-clicking
the icon (2) Clicking properties (3) clicking inside the shortcut input
field and (4) pressing the key that you want to use in conjunction with
Ctrl and Alt for your shortcut (i.e. if I were to click in the shortcut
input box and press, "f" the shortcut to bring up the program would be
"Ctrl+Alt+f").<br /> 				To learn more interesting shortcuts
