[[!meta title="The Meraki Solar Powered WiFi Kit"]]

<p>So, if you know me (which you don't; DON'T ACT LIKE YOU KNOW ME!) you know
that I loves me some WiFi. I'm constantly setting up an encryption key on my
router without looking to see if I can crack it, I enjoy building little
antennas or cantennas to see how far down the street I can get before I lose my
signal, basically I'm a geek with a penchant for WiFi. As such, I really want
this, what this is is a solar-powered WiFi kit. It's built for the outdoors and
is supposed to increase wireless connectivity range about 700 feet (which means
I could probably hop on <a

target="_blank">Watermark Books</a>' connection down the street). Plus it's
solar powered so no need for any extra wiring and it's saving the enviroment
(score one for the dolphins, I guess). So if you want to wire me some cash or
just send one of these bad boys straight to me, then feel free. As a side note
I'm also a huge fan of the wireless products over at <a
