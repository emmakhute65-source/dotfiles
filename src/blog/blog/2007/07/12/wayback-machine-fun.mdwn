[[!meta title="Wayback Machine Fun"]]

Most people on the internet have some favorite website that isn't around
anymore. Some people on the internet - me for instance - know where to find
that website. If your website was popular enough, chances are it got archived
and can now be found with the <a
href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php"
target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a> (I believe it was invented by a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Peabody"
target="_blank">Mr.Peabody</a>, however, this fact is, as yet,
unsubstantiated).<br /> The website I miss most in this world is currently
working via the Wayback Machine. I am refering to every guitarist's favorite
website: OLGA.<br />

alt="online guitar archive olga" /><br /> Not only is ole OLGA up, you can
still get <i>some</i> tabs from it. You can download any tab you want and, from
there, simply open it with <a
href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm"
target="_blank">Notepad++</a>, not just Windows default notepad, things'll look
all weird. Anyway, this discovery made me pee a little when I found it, so I
thought I'd share it.<br /> Also, you can use the Wayback Machine to laugh at
old incarnations of your favorite websites. Such as <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981202230410/http://www.google.com/"
target="_blank">Google from December 2nd, 1998</a> where under the link titled
<a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981202230410/http://www.google.com/stickers.html"
target="_blank">Google! Logos</a> I found a bitchin' logo.<br />
.<br /> Anyway, playing
is for pleasure so have some fun and play around with the Wayback Machine. See
if you can find some other old school website that still works, if you do,
share it with *balloontoablimp via email or in my shout box (I've already
tried using audiogalaxy [doesn't work], original MP3.com [doesn't work] and
singingfish.com [also, not working] - by 'not working' I mean that their
services no longer work, not the website itself).<br />EL FIN.
