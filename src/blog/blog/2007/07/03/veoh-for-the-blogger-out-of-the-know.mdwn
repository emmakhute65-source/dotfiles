[[!meta title="Veoh for the Blogger Out-of-the-Know"]]

So, for an in-the-know, pop-culture savy, finger-on-the-pulse-of-the-zeitgeist,
hyphenated-word-(over-)using, tech blogger I'm pretty out-of-the-know. I just
got turned on to a website called veoh by alexa traffic's <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070701212508/http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?cc=US&amp;ts_mode=country&amp;lang=none"
target="_blank">top 100 sites in the US</a> (it was #71 actually). I just
started using the site tonight and so far I'm diggin' it. I really don't think
it's necessary, however, to download the veoh player when you can watch any
video from the site online full-screen. TV on-demand online, I just love it so
darn much.
