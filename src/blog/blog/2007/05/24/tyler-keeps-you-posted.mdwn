<p>I realize that this update is long overdue, in fact, that is the point of
this update. I have been kind of busy lately what with the end of semester and
all, and I'd just like to share with you (because you're interested) a few of
the things I've been up to besides updating this blog.</p><ol><li>Makin' all
A's</li><li>Studying non-stop
for my <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/a/" target="_blank">Comptia A+</a> exam.</li><li>Working all week at the <a href="http://webs.wichita.edu/?u=erp&amp;p=/index"
target="_blank">WIN Office</a> on the Wichita State University campus. Yeah
I maintain the website, not impressed? Yeah, it's not that
great.</li><li>And Finally as of yesterday, <a
href="http://www.computermemoryupgrade.net/installing-laptop-memory.html"
target="_blank">I installed new RAM into my Laptop</a> and then installed
Windows XP Pro and <a
href="http://www.maximumpc.com/linux?page=0%2C0"
target="_blank">Ubuntu 7.04 to dual boot</a>, which, when all was said and
done, killed my day (no, not cause I'm stupid, just cause it
does).</li></ol>Well, I guess now everyone's up to date on ole Tyler's life
right now. It may not be entertaining, or interesting at all, but that's
how I roll son.<br /><br />
