<p>I know that this is a goofy little tech blog, but I think that a disaster that hit close to home (for me anyway) needs more attention than it's getting. My fear is that the Greensburg tornado will fade from the public mind just as quickly as it came. I would like to share with you all something about exactly how amazingly devastating this tornado was in a state where tornadoes, at least (I assume) in the national mindset, are thought to be commonplace. I have lived in Kansas my entire life and never once have I <i>even seen</i> a Tornado, I mean in real life. I have never known anyone who was affected by a tornado, and I have never seen a tornado (in my lifetime) cause as much damage as the tornado that touched down in Greensburg over the weekend. I feel terrible for the whole town, it's <i>unreal </i>how much damage the tornado did. I remember hearing on the news that the mayor said something like 95 percent of the town is destroyed. Since I live here in Kansas it's easy for me to donate to disaster relief, but if you live outside of Kansas and your city doesn't have a fund already set up you can send your donations to:</p><p>Midway-Kansas Chapter, American Red Cross, P.O. Box 3726, Wichita, KS 67201 </p>
