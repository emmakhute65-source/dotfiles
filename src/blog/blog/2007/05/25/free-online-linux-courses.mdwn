[[!meta title="Free Online Linux Courses"]]

I wouldn't have thought that I'd need a linux course what with my experience
with various live CD's, but a live CD and a HDD install are two different
things entirely. I can't seem to find anything in the file system without the
terminal. I just don't know where things go when I download them, what various
folders do, etc. etc. ad nausium. Whatever, anyway, I'm smart enough to know
when I need help. That's why when I was perusing the cleverly titled blog
[[Geeks Are
Sexy]](https://web.archive.org/web/20070701212920/http://www.geeksaresexy.net/),
I was really pumped (for lack of a better sounding word) when I saw this post.
