[[!meta title="Tech Blog of the Week? Me? That's Cool."]]

<p>DUNDUNDaDUHH! (that's right it's a triumphant music sound. I can use
onomatopoeia, I'm the tech blog of the week!) As my five or six regular readers
may already know, there exists a fantastic website called <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070701212822/http://www.dailycupoftech.com/" target="_blank">Daily
Cup of Tech</a> that I have featured on this website a few times (or maybe just
once, but really, who keeps track of these things?). You
also may or may not know that Daily Cup of Tech has a little award known as the
Tech Blog of the Week. For this week I share that title with one of my favorite
websites, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070701212822/http://www.howtogeek.com/"
target="_blank">The How-To Geek</a>. This award is, as most awards tend to be,
both a blessing and a curse. Sure, now I get some of that sweet sweet
recognition that I so long for, but, at the same time, I have to update this
site on a more regular basis and maybe actually put some quality content on
here. I know right now it seems like a long row to hoe, but friends, I
think I am just the Joe to hoe it!<br /> So long story short, this blog is
awesome and by extension you are awesome for reading it. Futhermore, this
blog's awesomeness has been verified through the fine third-party reporting of
Daily Cup of Tech. Kudos to the entire staff at DCoT for having amazing taste
in tech, and 'much props', as the kids say, to you, the reader, without which I
would be an insignificant amoeba lost and alone in the sad sea that is the
internet.<br /><br />...and on that note...</p> <h3>Here are a few of my

were to buy everything that I wanted from their site, I’d have no money left
for other, less important necessities in life like food and shelter."</li>
