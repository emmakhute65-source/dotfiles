<p>I'm not sure how many of my readers are aware of a little indie online 'zine
called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070701212704/http://www.steampunkmagazine.com/"
target="_blank">Steampunk magazine</a>, but if you're not hip to it yet it's
time to check it out for yourself. Steampunk has some great narratives,
features (like this issues 'Guide to Body Hair' and an exerpt from an 1887 book
about eagles), and interviews (like this issue's interview with I-Wei Huang who
creates steam-powered robots). Steampunk magazine is only in issue two, so you
haven't missed much, plus it's free to download. Where is the downside to
steampunk? Well, gosh darn it, I just don't know.<br />By the way...the quote
above is from the magazine, not just some random quote that has nothing to do
with anything.<br /><br /><a
