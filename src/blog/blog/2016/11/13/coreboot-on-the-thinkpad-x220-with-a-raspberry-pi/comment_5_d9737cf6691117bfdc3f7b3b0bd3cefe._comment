Hey,

I used this instructions before and they really helped me in the past. Now I bought another x220 and wanted to do the same and was quite confused, that I couldn't find the winbound chip anymore. I did the trick with spispeed=512 and expected to get it. Instead I needed to use the Macronix Chip with the flag '-c MX25L6405' as flashrom suggest, but needed a long time to get that.

So someone in the future: don't get confused, not every x220 has a winbound chip, just proceed ;-)

regards
