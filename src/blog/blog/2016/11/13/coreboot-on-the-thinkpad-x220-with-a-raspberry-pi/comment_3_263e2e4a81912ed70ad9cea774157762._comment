I was able to flash the new ROM internally (with a neutered ME - see [this guide](https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/wiki/Internal-flashing-with-coreboot)) by running the following command on the laptop: 

flashrom  -p internal:laptop=force_I_want_a_brick -c MX25L6445E -w coreboot_mecleaned.rom

Of course, you need to recompile coreboot first. But it does work :)
