Hi, I managed to get it running. But have a memory issue - linux sees only 8gb of ram (half installed) and it's speed is reduced, these are 1866MHz modules that worked well on hacked 1.41 bios' with coreboot Linux reports only 800MHz

Additionally, would be awesome if someone released 1.41 with protection removed. I would like to flash between original bios and coreboot without need to disassemble my laptop. The reason is that original BIOS supports UEFI and coreboot doesn't. With coreboot I can do reverse flash easly but other way it's not so easy. I possibly could tweak this myself but fully functional IDA is out of my reach.

Last thing, your config lacks console output to OS, apart from few other things that I had changed before compiling. Good job anyway and thumbs up!
