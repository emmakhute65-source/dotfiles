[CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1972516W/Code) by Charles Petzold

The language of computer hardware and software is not particularly well hidden
in my experience. The more I interact with software, the more those
interactions reflect their makers and materials. This fact is slowly permeating the zeitgeist
as we all, collectively, realize that [facebook is not
the](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/facebook-explains-what-it-bans-and-why/)
[open](https://act.eff.org/action/dear-facebook-authentic-names-are-authentically-dangerous-for-your-users)
[internet](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/technology/facebook-vietnam-war-photo-nudity.html?_r=0)
(no matter how much it may [insist on its own
benevolence](https://info.internet.org/en/)), and that the current state of AI
is simply one of [money laundering for
bias](http://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm). While it is increasingly true
that our high-level interactions with machines are
[broken](https://twitter.com/internetofshit), it's important to recall that we
haven't fixed any of the low-level problems either (tried subtracting
`399999999999998` from `399999999999999` in Google's calculator
[lately](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-do-computers-suck-at-math/)?).

These incredible Rube Goldberg, hacks-all-the-way-down, leaking piles of
abstractions that are modern computers are fascinating and powerful. The modern
computer reveals its own history -- each layer of abstraction representing a
previous geologic era. The [ancient `.plan`](http://www.dave.org/oldplans.html)
files of the Sumerians and Hittites.

_CODE_ builds forward through time. Revealing each innovation necessary to
create a fully functioning computer. It works its way towards the modern
computer starting with binary data representation using [morse
code](https://www.morsecode.io/). From there it covers non-base-10 number
systems, telegraphs, electromagnets and the invention of the relay, the
flip-flop switch that allows temporary storage of a single bit. All of this
background culminates in a truly wonderful chapter in which you use this
technology to build a fully functional computer in your mind's eye.

The book goes on to explain the [Von Neumann
architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) and from
there moves into topics with which I am more familiar -- high level programming
languages, object-oriented programming languages, and "The Graphical
Revolution". In these later chapters, an evident object-oriented/graphical/IDE
as the logical end-point for computing bias rears its ugly head, but in a book
published by Microsoft Press it's a surprisingly light touch.

_CODE_ is one of the more interesting technical books I have ever read, and
also one of the few that I read cover-to-cover over the course of a few reading
sessions. It is a story rather than a series of ideas surrounding a theme. It
is a history book, not a handbook.

My one critique is that the chapters after the climactic computer construction
feel a bit disjointed. There is no real conclusion to the book -- I expected a
more satisfying wrap-up than I was given. Instead of a tying-up of loose-ends
we move on to topics like object-oriented programming, and [IEEE 754
floating-point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985).  While
the treatment this book provides these topics is interesting, the organization
is somewhat lacking.

To spite the lack of organization towards the end of the book, I found _CODE_ a
wonderful read and would have no qualms recommending it to anyone at any level
of computer literacy.
