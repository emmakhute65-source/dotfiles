Here's my two cents:

Auto-repeat is silly. Why do you ever need to retype the same letter over and over again? Perhaps a dash for an ASCII line to create a visual bar. Auto-repeating is silly.

I'd like all the variants of a letter to appear in a context menu when you hold down a relevant letter. Holding down the dollar symbol? Maybe the euro, pound, etc symbols appear. Holding down the e, all the variations of éêë appear.

I think this is a more human approach. I doesn't require learning, or memorization in the same way that every other method I've seen requires. It's already been shown to us by smartphones etc.

Cheers,

Ashley
