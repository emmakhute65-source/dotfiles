I think that new FCC proposal for "[Restoring Internet
Freedom](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/proceedings?q=name:17-108)" would
completely destroy the internet. Should this proposal go any further, the
internet will no longer be recognizable within a very short amount of time. I'm
worried that I will no longer have a place on the internet because my internet
activity and work isn't designed to invade people's homes and privacy to sell
them things they don't need. Non-profits on the internet are dead.

This proposal is entirely rent-seeking by big ISPs. ISPs will make more
money without providing any additional service for users, and the FCC would be
enabling it all.

My comments to the FCC
---

The FCC has opened their proposal to [public
comment](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/proceedings?q=name:17-108) and I
encourage you to do so.

Here's what I wrote:

> not represent those of my employer), and I'm worried that new FCC rules may

>
> Meanwhile, large ISPs that move bits from the internet backbone over the

> This proposal has the net-effect of censoring the internet so that only
