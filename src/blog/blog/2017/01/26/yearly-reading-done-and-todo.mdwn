Reading fiction is not that dissimilar from watching a movie in your brain.
The ways in which audio-visual consumption of fiction and reading fiction
diverge is in their demand on engagement -- when reading I must learn new words, I
struggle to find meaning, I use my imagination, I slowly strengthen
understanding -- I meet books more than half-way in my mind's eye.

Movies and television, in contrast, demand less engagement from the viewer --
much of the vision and interpretation is handed (or forced) on the audience.
As popular movies and TV demand less, they also seem more apt to acquiesce to
popular whim -- mirroring the culture that consumes them rather
than challenging it. The level of engagement demanded by audio-visual
entertainment is also subject to a shifting baseline -- that is, it's gotten
less challenging over time.

This is not a knock on *all* television and movies as a form of art. Often
television, movies, and documentaries are the perfect medium to convey a particular
message. Also, there are many movies and television programs which are, in
fact, very challenging to their audience in addition to being very enjoyable.

Also, it is noteworthy that I tend to read mass-market crap -- the
book-equivalent of high-fructose corn syrup. I've come to terms with this fact.
I read some crap, I read some good things, occasionally I'll read a few great
(and nominally "great") things. I end up with a greater sense of accomplishment
and satisfaction from reading crap rather than watching crap -- YMMV.

This is a long way of saying -- I think that reading is a Good Thingâ„¢ and
I want to do more of it. To enforce more of a habit, I set reading goals
for myself at the start of each year. In 2015 I wanted to read a book a month.
In 2016 I wanted to read 2 books a month. In both 2015 and 2016 my grasp has
exceeded my reach -- which is not how goals are supposed to work.

I also [[reviewed|tags/books]] a couple of these books over the course of 2016,
hopefully I can continue down that path in the year to come.

Goals for 2017
---

I'm going to try to read roughly a book a week in 2017 -- 50 books for the year.
Hopefully 50 books is an ambitious enough goal.
Additionally, I'd like to try to do 6 book reviews on this blog as a means of:

* Tracking what I've read
* Checking my understanding
* Engaging and owning what I've read

I'd also like to lay claim to my crazy ambitious plan to read 4 whole, real, grown-up (i.e., not
beer- or computer-related) non-fiction books this year.

As I'm proclaiming these goals publicly for the first time, I'm sure I'll come up woefully and shamefully short -- yay blogging! :)
