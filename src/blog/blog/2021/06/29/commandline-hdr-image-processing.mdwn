Expensive cameras don't take better photos. Folks tend to learn this when
they do the first side-by-side between their gorgeous iPhoneograhy and the **objectively worse**
shots taken with their fancy new $2,000 DSLR.

Cell phones have itty-bitty sensors and equally lilliputian optics -- how can
they take better pictures?  Google research has described the technique that
their phones use -- called "burst" photography -- in [research
papers](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/hdrplusdata.org/en//hdrplus.pdf)
and
[blogs](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/experimental-nighttime-photography-with.html?m=1).
Essentially, they take a whole bunch of pictures and mash them together to make a single good picture.

By mimicking the techniques that our cell phones use
to take better pictures we get [less noisy](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/image-averaging-noise.htm), more dynamic photos along with the
improved light gathering capabilities of a DSLR.

## Capture

[High dynamic range](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/high-dynamic-range.htm)
images have a large range of brightness in the sceneâ€”some light areas, some
dark areas. By blending an underexposed image that captures detail in bright
areas of the scene with an overexposed image that captures detail in dark areas
of the scene you can capture a range of brightness that would not be possible
with a single photograph.

In the picture above, taken on the
[pinto arch trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/pinto) in Moab,
Utah, there are two exposures of one scene: the immediate surroundings are in a
shadow, the sky and butte in the distance are in the bright sunlight. Below
I've blended the shots into a single scene with a wide range of brightness --
an HDR image:

I captured the image above using the following equipment:

- [Nikon D610](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D610)
- [Samyang Optics / Rokinon AF 14 mm f/2.8 FE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samyang_Optics_/_Rokinon_AF_14_mm_f/2.8_FE)

And that's it: no tripod and no filters. I shot the image handheld at f/11 ISO
200.

The shutter speed for underexposed photo was 1/400 sec. For the overexposed
photo it was 1/60 sec. I varied the shutter speed using the
[exposure bracketing](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/learn-and-explore/a/tips-and-techniques/exposure-bracketing-the-creative-insurance-policy.html)
feature of the Nikon D610.

## Processing

After capturing my under- and over-exposed photos I use the following software
programs:

- `align_image_stack` which is part of the `hugin` package
- `enfuse` which is part of the `enblend` family of FOSS photo tools
- [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) to make final edits and lens correction
- `exiftool` to manage metadata

First, I import my images using a [bash script](https://github.com/thcipriani/dotfiles/blob/master/srv/photos/lib/import.sh)
I wrote that maintains a strict file structure. Next, I use Darktable to do
lens correction (based on the astounding achievement that is the
[lensfun database](https://lensfun.github.io/)) then I export as 16-bit tif files.

At this point, since I shot the images without a tripod, they have minor
misalignments. `align_image_stack` corrects the misalignments and
creates a perfect stack of images:

```{.bash}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# align.sh
# ---
# By default align image stack tries to find 8 control points in a 5x5 grid
# This finds 16 control points in a 10x10 grid.
align_image_stack \
    -a aligned_ -v -m \
    -g 10 -c 16 -C \
    "$@"
```
I use the command `align.sh *.tif` with the above script to create aligned
images.

This command creates precisely aligned, stackable tif files with the prefix
`aligned_` in the current directory.

Notice in the image above -- taken just East of [Moran Point](https://www.nps.gov/places/000/moran-point.htm) at the Grand Canyon in
Arizona -- that the underexposed image shows more detail in the clouds and the
sun, whereas in the overexposed image shows much more detail in the canyon and
on the rocks in the foreground.

Now I use the enfuse command to produce a not-offensively-garish HDR image of
the aligned images: `enfuse -o out.tif aligned_000*` .

![Grand canyon hdr](https://photos.tylercipriani.com/thumbs/ce/2f34ff201e443d4875eff46200d7c3/large.jpg)

In the final image, we retain both the detail of the sun and clouds in the sky
as well as a clear view of the canyon (and its grandeur) and the rocks in the
foreground.

This is a technique I use **constantly** to capture shots that would be
impossible any other way, AND(!) it uses tools and techniques that are useful
for all FOSS photography nerds. Best of all? No high-falutin cellular phone
required.
