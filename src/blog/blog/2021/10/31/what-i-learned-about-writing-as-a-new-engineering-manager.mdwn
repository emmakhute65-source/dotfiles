Software engineering managers' most precious resource is time. But you
wouldn't know it from reading our emails--bloated screeds of business buzzwords
that we expect engineers to decipher.

Here are some tips on how to write an email so people will read it.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Have a point

Make sure you have something to say before you write.

Corporate-speak will write your email for you unless you remain vigilant[^1].
Jargon lulls the writer into the false belief that they've said something
precise while your reader is left wondering whether you've said anything at all.

Be direct and start your draft with the purpose of the email;  **ask what you
want to ask or say what you want to say before writing anything else**. This
way: you can't overwrite and forget to include your point. You can always wrap
your plain language in the requisite business shibboleths later.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Keep it short

> Write as if you were dying. At the same time, assume you write for an
> audience consisting solely of terminal patients.
>
> -- Annie Dillard, _The Writing Life_

Everything you write is too long.

People reading your emails aren't fans of your writing‚Äîthey're trying to get
through their email.

When you've finished writing your email use Stephen King's equation from _On
Writing_: "**2nd Draft = 1st Draft ‚Äì 10%**". Your writing will be more
effective.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Make it easy

> All visually displayed text involves typography

Appropriate typography and thoughtful information architecture make your email
easier to read. **It's not enough email to <u>be</u> easy to read; it's got to <u>look</u> easy to read**.

Researchers at the University of Michigan gave student test subjects two
identical sets of instructions: one in a hard-to-read font and one in an
easy-to-read font.

Despite the steps being identical, the student's predictions of the difficulty of the tasks
differed. They thought the more intimidating text was a more demanding
task even though it was the same task. The author's conclusion is the title of their study: "[If it's Hard to
Read, It's Hard to Do][]."

Break up long text with headings. Keep your paragraphs short. Use bullet points
and short sentences to make your text look less intimidating and easier to
read.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£  Make it ‚ú®pretty‚ú®

I know. Emojis üôÑ.

In her book _Because Internet_, author and linguist Gretchen McCulloh posits that
people embraced emojis because of their utility. Emojis are emblems of natural
gesticulation --- they add body language to our text.

**Emojis can help people process the shape of your text at a glance**. I use emojis
to lead the eye through a text. Emojis are precognitive signposts you can use
to reinforce the meaning of your writing.

Emojis can't substitute for substance, but they can lower barriers for your
readers.

I ‚ù§Ô∏è the judicious use of emojis.
