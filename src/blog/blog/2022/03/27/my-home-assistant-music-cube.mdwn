Last year, I spent $17 on an [Aqara cube](https://www.aqara.com/us/cube.html),
and it's been one of my best purchases for enjoyment per dollar spent.

The Aqara cube is a three-inch square plastic cube that sends gestures over Zigbee to a
[cheap off-the-shelf dongle](https://www.amazon.com/dresden-elektronik-ConBee-Universal-Gateway/dp/B07PZ7ZHG5/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=zigbee+dongle&qid=1648415026&sr=8-4).

By pairing this cube with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), I
have a three-dimensional button with 45 unique interactions to control whatever
I want.

And over the last six months, I've used it to control a small fleet of
antiquated streaming devices to help me discover new music.

## üé≠ The Tragedy of the Logitech Squeezebox

The Logitech Squeezebox is a bygone streaming device that was too beautiful for
this world. Logitech snuffed the Squeezebox in 2012.

But because others share my enthusiasm for Squeezeboxes, there's still
hope. The second-hand market persists. And there are wonderful nerds
[cobbling together Squeezeboxes from Raspberry Pis](https://www.picoreplayer.org/).

I built a DIY Squeezebox from a Pi Zero [Pimoroni
PirateRadio](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pirate-radio-pi-zero-w-project-kit?variant=38476372426)
kit and [Squeezelite](https://github.com/ralph-irving/squeezelite) software.

I blanket my humble abode in music by combining a DIY PirateRadio, a Squeezebox Boom, and a Squeezebox Touch.

My Dockerized Logitech Media Server perfectly synchronizes these three devices.
Music from Spotify or [WQXR](https://www.wqxr.org/) is seamless when you walk
from bedroom to kitchen to dining room.

## Home Assistant is ‚ú®magic‚ú®

Home Assistant is open-source home automation software, and it's the only IoT
software I don't find myself screaming at regularly.

And, of course, there's a [Logitech Squeezebox integration for Home
Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/squeezebox). The
integration lets you use Logitech Media Server's (somewhat
[esoteric](https://gist.github.com/samtherussell/335bf9ba75363bd167d2470b8689d9f2))
API to control your devices from Home Assistant.

I also use a community-made [Home Assistant Blueprint](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/mi-magic-cube-deconz-45-actions/256656) that automates each of the cube's 45 unique gestures.

Currently, since my mental stack is tiny, I only use four gestures:

1. **Shake**: Turn on all players, and start playing a random album from Spotify (that's right, **album** -- I'm old enough to yearn for the halcyon days of [Rdio](https://github.com/thcipriani/rdio-shit#rdio-shit)).
2. **Double-tap**: Turn off all players.
3. **Flip**: Next track.
4. **Twist**: Twist right for volume up; twist left for volume down -- like a volume knob.

## üßê Why would anyone do this?

In a 2011 article, ‚Äú[A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/),‚Äù Brett
Victor describes **touchscreens** as ‚Äúpictures under glass.‚Äù **I loathe pictures
under glass**.

It's impossible to use a device with a touchscreen without looking at it. And touchscreen
interaction is slow -- traversing a menu system is all point-and-click, there
are no shortcuts.

Another alternative is control via **smart speakers** -- devices
literally straight out of a dystopian novel.

While the smart speaker is the closest thing to a ubiquitous command-line interface in everyday use, **I'm too weirded-out
to have a smart speaker in my house**.

I've opted for a better way: shake a cube and music appears.

**The cube is a pleasant tactile experience** -- shake it, tap it, spin it -- its
a weighty and fun fidget toy. **Its design affords instant access to all its
features** -- there is no menu system to dig through.

The cube is frictionless [calm technology](https://calmtech.com/) and it's behaved beautifully in the background of my day-to-day for months.
