[[!meta title="Why Is There So Much Unemployment in a Depression?"]]

<h2><a href="/web/20090820011215/http://correspondents.theatlantic.com/richard_posner/2009/06/why_is_there_unemployment_in_a_depression.php"  target="_blank" >Why Is There So Much Unemployment in a Depression?</a></h2>

Richard Posner helps to bridge the gap between a priori conclusions about unemployment during a recession/depression with the observable truths. Very interesting and highly recommended - if you&#8217;re a dorky armchair economist like myself.
