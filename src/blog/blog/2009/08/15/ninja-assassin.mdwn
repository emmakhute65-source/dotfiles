This Movie looks Awesome - anything with ninjas is awesome, really. I’ve never been a ninja naysayer - even when all them other brotha’s be hatin’. Also, if you get your fingers just off the Home Keys on the keyboard and try to type ninja, you end up typing “mom” and that’s not right. Mom is not equal to ninja.
