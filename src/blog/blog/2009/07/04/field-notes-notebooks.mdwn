This has been another recent obsession of mine. These simple field notebooks are quite a step-up from a moleskine in design but a step down in price. Sweet.

Also, be sure to check out the [Draplin Design company](http://draplin.com/) and [Coudal Partners](http://www.coudal.com/) (the duo responsible for these mean little notepads).

Also, check out Aaron Draplin on Vimeo to find out why [America is F*cked…Graphically at least](http://vimeo.com/1465284).

Also, I’m love Futura.

That is all.
