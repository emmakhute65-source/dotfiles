TIL how to tie my shoes üòê.

I figured this out today -- the last day of 2019 -- while I was tying together
two ends of [cotton sash cord][0] to make a loop. I suddenly noticed my square
knot didn't look like the cover of the [Boy Scouts knot book][1].

I looked up the square knot on [animatedknots.com][2] -- which is an amazing
site with step-by-step instructions for all kinds of knots. Sure enough, I had
been doing wrong -- left-over-right, left-over-right -- a *granny* knot vs a
*square* knot.

This was satisfying, if a little embarassing -- I somehow made it through Cub
Scouts without learning to tie a square knot. As I kept reading
animatedknots.com I learned something else:

>  The Square (Reef) Knot [...] is usually learned when we tie
>  the laces on our first pair of shoes. Admittedly it is usually a bow that we
>  tie ‚Äì but the underlying knot is a Square (Reef) Knot.

I quickly untied and retied my shoes -- left-over-right, left-over-right --
damnit -- a granny knot. It's especially frustrating given that I'd seen [Ian's
Shoelace Site's page on Granny Knots][3] forever ago and dismissed it because my
shoelace bows weren't askew.

So here I am -- a living cautionary tale. It's the last day of 2019. I'm 33.
And I *just* learned to tie my shoes üå†.
