[[!meta title="Library Thing(s)"]]

Earlier this year, I stumbled across [[Library
Thing|https://www.librarything.com]] and almost immediately decided that
I wanted to joinâ€”which is a rare thing for me concerning online
services.

So I did what any normal person would do and I bought a [[barcode
scanner|https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00406YZGK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1]]
and wrote some python to build my catalog.

The [[python
script|https://github.com/thcipriani/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/LibraryThing]]
is just a loop that shows a prompt and waits for an ISBN, <code>t</code> to input a
tag, <code>q</code> to quit. Meanwhile it's generating a csv file that
can be uploaded to LibraryThing.

The fruits of this labor were/are my (and Blazey's) [[Library Thing Catalog|https://www.librarything.com/catalog/thcipriani]]
